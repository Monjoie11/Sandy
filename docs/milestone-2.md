## State of the Sandwich Address
#### Milestone 2: j'ai mang√© ton chat

The image you are looking at is a test image (11 more drawables in the folder) that will be part of the malingering (sandwich_style 0 in Room) image set. The code loading test_image11 into Room can be seen in the SandyDatabase Class. I am going to explore the benefits/possibility of entering/accessing this data via arrays.

At present, when you touch Sandy's Buns  you go to a blank fragment. My next goal is to crate a tutorial method that cycles through all 12 test images as her basic education. Its going to take some thinking to figure out how, if the more elegant arrays option is used to this end, are vales stored in room with the appropriate entities....but as all things written, I think I may have just gotten an idea as I typed this.

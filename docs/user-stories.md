# Legends of Saint Sandy

### User 1
I'm a 19-year-old college student at In-N-Out burger with my friends. One of them has a new app and takes a picture of his burger, then he laughs and starts taking pictures of his fries, his drink, his shoe. He asks me to hold my hands sideways with my car keys in them, takes a picture and laughs, saying "I got her!" He shows me the app. I download it immediately.

I'm a high school junior and I keep seeing posts on my friends' FB page asking me if I like so-and-so's sandwich, but its a picture of a monster can between two slices of bread. I click on the post and download the app.

I'm a 36-year-old psychologist who thinks image recognition is really cool. My brother tells me about this stupid app his boyfriend is using all the time, taking pictures of food. I think it sounds like a great way to waste 5 min here and there, so  download it and immediately start trying to se how I can trick it. The picture interface is fun for me, but the AI is hilarious.

I've been sent 30 years back in time to destroy John Connor. I'm a walking, unfeeling robotic death incarnate (of course I have no real flesh, so death insynthate?) but I need to blend in with these humans, and I know they live off sandwiches.  I use this "smart phone" (the naming convention infuriates me) to determine if what's in front of me is a sandwich I should pretend to eat.
